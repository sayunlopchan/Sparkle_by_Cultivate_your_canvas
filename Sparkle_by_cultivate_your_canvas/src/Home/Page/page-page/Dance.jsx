      <p>At Sparkle Kids Academy, our dance program, led by esteemed instructor Rosy Shrestha, offers children an exceptional opportunity to explore the art of dance. This program is designed to foster both physical and cognitive development in a structured yet creative environment. Through our curriculum, students will enhance their coordination, balance, and flexibility, while also cultivating discipline and focus. Dance encourages self-expression and creativity, providing children with the tools to build confidence and resilience. Under Rosy Shrestha's expert guidance, our program not only teaches the technical aspects of dance but also instills a deep appreciation for the art form, preparing students for future success both on and off the stage.</p>
